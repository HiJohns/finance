## System Beacon Todo List\n\nBased on the README.md, here's a todo list for the finance system:\n\n### Module 1: Python Strategy Lab (The Lab)\n\n- [ ] Implement Risk Profiler:\n    - [ ] Calculate annualized volatility.\n    - [ ] Calculate Maximum Drawdown (MDD).\n    - [ ] Calculate Beta value relative to S\&P 500.\n- [ ] Implement MWU Dynamic Adjustment Weight Engine:\n    - [ ] Implement the Multiplication Weights Update (MWU) algorithm.\n    - [ ] Automatically reduce weights on assets with systemic drops (Loss increase).\n    - [ ] Shift weights to cash or low volatility assets (e.g., UBS/German ETF).\n\n### Module 2: Go Risk Sentinel (The Sentinel)\n\n- [ ] Implement Real-time Stop Loss and Water Level Monitoring:\n    - [ ] Poll market data API.\n    - [ ] Implement hard stop-loss logic (e.g., 15% drawdown).\n    - [ ] Implement technical level monitoring (e.g., price below 200-day moving average).\n    - [ ] Output instant desktop notifications or emails.\n- [ ] Implement Whale Anomaly Detection:\n    - [ ] Monitor SLV (Silver) and GLD (Gold) for Volume-Price Divergence (VPD).\n    - [ ] Identify if major players are retreating based on volume spikes and price stagnation.\n\n### Module 3: Macro and Financial Audit (The Auditor)\n\n- [ ] Implement Mag 7 Input-Output Ratio Monitoring (AI-ROI Tracker):\n    - [ ] Parse financial statements (10-Q/10-K).\n    - [ ] Calculate Capex Intensity (Capital Expenditure / Total Revenue).\n    - [ ] Calculate FCF Yield (Free Cash Flow Yield).\n    - [ ] Monitor the burning money efficiency of Mag 7.\n    - [ ] Trigger pre-warning reduction in tech stocks if Capex growth > Revenue growth.\n\n### Module 4: Execution Module (The Exec)\n\n- [ ] Implement Integer Programming Execution (Discrete Optimizer):\n    - [ ] Use `cvxpy` to solve the Integer Knapsack problem.\n    - [ ] Calculate the actual number of shares to buy that are closest to the target proportion, under A-share (100 shares per lot) and high-priced U.S. stock restrictions.\n\n### Schedule\n\n- [ ] **In session (7x24)**: Monitor stop loss levels and whale movements (Go Risk Sentinel).\n- [ ] **Every Friday closing**: Update asset risk profile (Python Strategy Lab).\n- [ ] **Earnings Season (2/25)**: Analyze Nvidia Capex conversion rate (Macro Financial Analyzer).\n- [ ] **February 24th wealth management unlocked**: Execute purchase using integer programming algorithm (Execution Module).\n
